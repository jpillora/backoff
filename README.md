# Backoff

A simple backoff algorithm in Go (Golang)

# Usage

Starts at `Min`, multiplied by `Factor` every call to
`Duration()` where it is capped at `Max`. Commonly used
in conjunction with `time.Sleep(duration)`.

``` go

b := &backoff.Backoff{
	//These are the defaults
	Min:    100 * time.Millisecond,
	Max:    10 * time.Second,
	Factor: 2,
}

fmt.Printf("%s\n", b.Duration())
fmt.Printf("%s\n", b.Duration())
fmt.Printf("%s\n", b.Duration())

fmt.Printf("Reset!\n")
b.Reset()

fmt.Printf("%s\n", b.Duration())
```

```

Reset!

```
